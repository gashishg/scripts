# Gradle ApplyFrom Scripts
These scripts are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewmccullough/gradle-applyfrom-scripts) for the purposes of allowing direct `applyFrom` use from the web, or cloning of this repository to your local disk as a collection of useful Gradle add-ons.

## Use
In your Gradle build file, simply path to one of the scripts in its raw form as follows:

    apply from: 'http://github.com/breskeby/gradleplugins/raw/master/emmaPlugin/emma.gradle'


## Acknowledgements
JIRA tickets and the Cookbook are the primary sources of inspiration for these scripts.

## Contributions
Community contributions to these scripts are welcomed. They are, in short, like an amplified and working version of cookbook materials. Cookbooks are great, but they facilitate copy-and-paste coding. I'd rather see the prescribed solutions in a cookbook put into executable form where we can fork, fix, and commit changes to them over time.
